      <description>Hi, folks! In this, the first blog post on my site, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain a bit about one of my research projects that I&amp;rsquo;m especially excited about lately. I&amp;rsquo;ll aim to keep it at a level that is understandable for &amp;ldquo;non-experts,&amp;rdquo; but inevitably there will be some astro jargon that creeps in&amp;hellip; -Jeff
The sparsely-populated outermost regions of our Milky Way galaxy are poorly studied. In part, this is because stars of a given type become fainter the more distant they are from us &amp;ndash; think about a flashlight: if I stand a few feet away from you, it will look pretty bright (you could read a book by its light), while if I&amp;rsquo;m a block away, it will just look like a small point of light.</description>
